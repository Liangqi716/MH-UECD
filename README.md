# Multi-scenario Heterogeneous UAV Energy Consumption Dataset (MH-UECD)
To evaluate the performance of energy consumption models across diverse flight scenarios and heterogeneous UAV types, we construct the Multi-scenario Heterogeneous UAV Energy Consumption Dataset (MH-UECD).

## 📂 Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized hierarchically by **UAV type** and **environmental conditions**, containing approximately **1,760** flight trajectories in total.

Note: The rotary_wing_2 directory contains fewer samples because its compact size limits the viable payload range.
